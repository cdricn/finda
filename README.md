# Finda
An aggregator website for community posts looking for teams in itch.io gamejams using React and Nextjs.

# How it works
Calls an API that scrapes itch.io game jams for posts that are about users finding teams or members and displays them in the website based on the filtered category. For more info about the API, visit: https://github.com/cdricn/itch-jamcommunity-api.
